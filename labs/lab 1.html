<p>
  
  Your words, your memories
Fill this tiny world.
It's a pleasant today,
Like the few minutes at the end of the movie.
  
The fate you take, the fate you let go,
Just goes on increasing,
Even though I noticed that small open seam.
 
Until my heart overlooks this body,
Until I go to a world with no tomorrow,
To count all the things that will be lost,
 
Just call that love,
 
Just call it love.
 
Your smile is also as immature as one that
I will no longer be able to see it in the blink of an eye.
If that is so, from the beginning,
It would have been better to remain unbeknownst of loving gestures.
 
Because the passing life-time, and the unchanging regrets,
Are called life,
That's why I am attracted to you to the extent that
I can't help it.
 
To have longed for you who have left,
As far as the other side that can't be reached even if I try to extend this hand,
Further than what I see in my dreams,
 
Just call that love,
 
Just call it love.
